1. In normal circumstances i.e. without a userspace fork, does a single executable run as a single process
even if it contains independent linked object files?
- Yes. However the current situation, the goal is to establish a parent-child relationship between
two independent processes via an ioctl call from the child.

if (current is soldier):
    current->ppid...
else {
    look for task struct with pid = soldierpid (sent from user)
    for_each_process
}
